RTS
===
Premise:  Mad scientists bent on world domination!!

Object of game:  research greater and greater genetic manipulation techniques (unit attributes) in an attempt to eleminate 
your foes.  Once all opposition is defeated the world is yours for the taking.

Each player starts in a tiny lab with only one robo-minion.  The player has only limited options available at this point:
  1) build another helper robot
  2) research a creature
  3) send the robo-minion scouting instead of build a robot?
  4) maybe you start with one robo-builder?
  
  either way......
  
You have two paths of research available in the begining:
  1) Robot
  2) Genetic
  
  In order to use genetic research you need to harvest "subjects" to run experements on.
  "Subjects" are found in settlements like regular resources (ore, wood) and respawn at a set rate given their size so
  you must make sure to not "harvest" too many as you may disrupt their population (i.e. kill the buggers).
  Some "subjects" or namads and can be found as tiny encampments that spawn throughout the board (you can kill these buggers, harvest away).
