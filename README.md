Premise:  Mad scientists bent on world domination!!

Object of game:  research greater and greater genetic manipulation techniques (unit attributes) in an attempt to eleminate 
your foes.  Once all opposition is defeated the world is yours for the taking.

Each player starts in a tiny lab with only one robo-minion.  The player has only limited options available at this point:

  1) build another helper robot
  
  2) research a creature
  
  3) send the robo-minion scouting instead of build a robot?
  
  4) maybe you start with one robo-builder?
  
  either way......
  
You have two paths of research available in the begining:
  1) Robot
  2) Genetic
  
  In order to use genetic research you need to harvest "subjects" to run experements on.
  "Subjects" are found in settlements like regular resources (ore, wood) 
  and respawn at a set rate given their size so
  you must make sure to not "harvest" too many as you may disrupt 
  their population (i.e. kill the buggers).
  Some "subjects" or namads and can be found as tiny encampments 
  that spawn throughout the board (you can kill these buggers, harvest away).
  
  When researching Robots you harvest the usual resources, metal, fuel, etc...
  When you use genetic research you have to have "food" in order to feed your minions.
  Fuel and Food act the same.

Surviving scientist on a planet that just defended itself against a technologically advanced alien race.

This gives us our 3 recources:
  *  Alien Tech
  *  Pre-war Tech
  *  Weapons/Ammo (Arms)

Mutant path:
  *  Alien Tech
  *  Pre-war Tech

Robot path:
  *  Alien Tech
  *  Weapons

Human path:
  *  Weapons
  *  Pre-war Tech
  
Map characteristics:
  *  Procedurally generated
  *  Day/Night cycle
  *  Night cycle spawns "enemies"
  *  Night will be bad for Humans; reduced visability, slower movement? etc...
  *  Day will be bad for Mutants;  reduced visability, more damage? etc...
  *  
  *  only bi-level ?
  *  water ?
  *  do different terrains spawn different "enemies"; 
     does a map with no dessert fail to produce "enemies" w/venom? 

Avatar: Yes
  *  The robot upgrading could depend on it as the "final piece" to teching-up (the brain-throne idea)
  *  The mutants would give the ability to pull a "Mr. Hyde" / Berserker rage
  *  The humans would get shafted on the avatar upgrading unless they had some kind of "moral" bonus.

Avatat: No
  *  What is there to say?

  ==========================================================================================
  
You're a lone human with the determination to survive in a post apocalyptic world. 
Using automation, mutation, and diplomacy, you can bend the populace to your will,
give them hope for a new future, or snuff out their lives for your own gain.

Should you choose to improve in automation, you will receive:
  * Advanced food production, weapons manufacturing, and armor forging.
  * Killer robots to assert your will.
  * Automated turrets to defend your goods.

Becoming knowledgeable in the area of mutation will grant you:
  * Super soldiers capable of withstanding blasts that would kill a man thrice over.
  * Mutant freaks that can spit acid, see in the dark, and camouflage themselves.
  * Resistance to hot, cold, and a reduced need for nutrition/medicine.

Learning the art of diplomacy will give you the ability to:
  * Persuade others to follow you in your quest for survival.
  * Inspire those around you to great acts of courage and determination.
  * Drive others to further your goals, better themselves, or to just get things done.
