Surviving scientist on a post-apocolyptic planet, 
OR that just defended itself against a technologically advanced alien invasion.

This gives us our 3 recources (plus metal):

  * Software
  * Biomass
  * Weapons/Ammo (Arms)
  * METAL

Resource harvesting:
Towns / Ruins, Crash sites and Military dropspots are "scavanged" for the different resource types.
  
  * Plots are few and far between and are not "sprawling" but are instead only a few "squares" in area making them eay to miss
  * Scavanging results in HUGE payoffs but only rarely and plots DON'T replenish
  * This way would play out better if the resources were single resource plots that a player could decide 
    to bypass instead of "waisting" there time. 

Mutant path:
  
  * METAL
  * Software
  * Biomass

Robot path:

  * METAL
  * Software
  * Weapons

Human path:
  
  * METAL
  * Weapons
  * Biomass

Map characteristics:

  * Procedurally generated
  * Day/Night cycle
  * Night cycle spawns "enemies"
  * Night will be bad for Humans; reduced visability, slower movement? etc...
  * Day will be bad for Mutants; reduced visability, more damage? etc...
  * Robots might overheat during the day and spend too much power at night (cuz they're solar and THE STRONGEST)
    what about a 4 part day cycle? day = bad for mutant, night = bad for humans, dawn / dusk = even odds
    only one level (just barriers)? or bi-level (with ramps?)?  water ?  do different terrains spawn 
    different "enemies"; does a map with no desert fail to produce "enemies" w/venom?

Avatar: Yes

  * The robot upgrading could depend on it as the "final piece" to teching-up (the brain-throne idea)
  * The mutants would give the ability to pull a "Mr. Hyde" / Berserker rage
  * The humans would get shafted on the avatar upgrading unless they had some kind of "moral" bonus.

About Nomad-style play:

  * Instead of using the lab you start in you decide to scavange it (this would make your avatar mad buff so you could last the night solo)
    your focus is solely on attack
  * Your units would be the buffest in the game (I'm thinking 25-35 maxed out nomads could win the game)
    "all" your resources would be spent on converting tech into weapons even if you used alien tech or pre-war tech 
     you'd pretty much just make weapons with it (with a few exceptions; guard dogs/elec fences)

People: recruit only (If you never "made" humans)

  * People would be the only unit resource.
  * Your units would only come from NPCs who either joined or got caught.
  * As you recruited more humans and gained greater tech you would spend "regular" resources "outfitting" individuals instead of making new higher level units
  * They would need to regenerate so that when they retreated they would eventually recover (I wanted this to take "food"?)
  * People (NPCs) COULD just wander around everywhere outside (during the day) and when they saw you they would just join you (if you had humans)
  * Robots and mutants would have to "catch" humans but NPC humans are drawn to other humans (hum > robo+mut = join freely)

Teching up:
Devices VS Structures

  * Structures allow an enemy to destroy your tech
  * Devices allow an enemy to destroy your tech (AND steal it?)
  *

Tech Tree:

  So the one I drew (on google drive) "starts" at the stars for each pure "tech path".  The non-colored nodes are 
  "in-between tech" that are a combo
